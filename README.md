A Farmers Connectivity App(Website)
The 'Farmers Economic District' (FED) is a project developed as a mini social media platform to connect farmers with one another. This will allow farms post updates regarding to need for hired help, need for tools for trade or purchase. This will allow states who depend on farming to get the message out, regarding environmental situations such as fire, storms, famine, or other situations. Farmers from other states will be connected to one another, making it easier for the Federal Department of Agriculture to better develop our Agriculture industry.
